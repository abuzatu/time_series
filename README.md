Created by Adrian Buzatu on 29 Nov 2020 for time series prediction examples.

First example is predicting the number of tractor sales given the month, using 12 years of montly data, and predicting the following three years. The principle components are derived, while ARIMA is only mentioned a full model for real life.

Second example is visualizing stock market prices and other info as a function of datetime, so in a time series.
